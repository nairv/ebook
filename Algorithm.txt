Greedy algorithm for table cell selection
---------------------------------------------------

Following is a naive cell selection algorithm for cell selection:

1) Generate buckets ( sets ) for every row and every column O(rows * columns)
2) Parse through the selected cells and put it into appropriate bucket. This means put a particular point in both the buckets which it falls into( corresponding row and column bucket)
3) Generate a set F = {B| B is a bucket containing some selected point and |B| != 0}
4) Initialize U = Set of selected points

	while(U != 0)
	{
		select B such that |B| is max in F
		U = U - B;
		C = C union B
	}

	return C;
